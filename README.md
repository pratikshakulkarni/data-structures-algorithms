#Graphs:
    1. Implementation :
        AdjacencnyList => use of linked list to show node and its assocoiated neighbors
        Ajacency Matrix => use of 2d matrix where rows and columns are the nodes in the graph
    3. Types Of Graphs:
        -Undirected graphs.
        -Directed graphs.
        -Weighted graphs.
        -Undirected weighted graphs.
        -Directed weighted graphs.
    2. Traversal:
        -BFS => Breadth First Search
        -DFS => Depth First Search
    3. Single source shortest path algorithms: (DFS doesn't work)
        -BFS  Time Complexity => O(E) Space Complexity => O(V) (BFS for SSSPP doesn't work for weighted graph)
        -Dijkstra's Algorithm
